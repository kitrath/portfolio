# Portfolio

## Description
This is the first iteration of my portfolio website, originally developed as the week 2 challenge for the KU Coding Bootcamp (December 2022). The site contains a brief paragraph of text about me and links to my work and contact information. The site uses [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) and [Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) to adapt its design to various screen widths from mobile to desktop. The *Work* section of the current version of this page links only to my first two products from bootcamp. In order to fill out the design of this first version of the site, the final three links and pictures are placeholders.  As the bootcamp continues, all five of the current linked artifacts will be replaced with more substantive work samples.

## Roadmap
1. *Revisit Design*: I plan to keep developing this site.  I'd like to employ a structured design process using a tool like Figma in order to rehearse different designs before re-working the CSS.

2. *CSS Grid*: I still need to learn about CSS Grid and discover how to combine it with either Flexbox or Media Queries (or both) to build a smooth, responsive experience.

3. *Application Images*: I would prefer to use images of my application interfaces that integrate with an overall page design better than the two I have used here.  I intend to learn more about best practices for integrating image content with CSS and HTML.  For example, instead of loading blurred images to the page, in a future version of the site, I'd like to structure HTML in a way that allows me to blur the images interactively using [CSS Filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter-function/blur).
